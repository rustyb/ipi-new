### Membership Committee
 
All applications are initially sent to the membership committee for consideration and recommendation to Council.  The final decision regarding membership lies with the Council.  The committee, chaired by the Membership Secretary handles its business via online collaboration in the first instance with meetings called as necessary.  The key dates for approval of applications are the actual IPI Council meetings which are generally held at the start of each month. The Membership Committee aims to handle all pending applications recieved prior a Council meeting but from time to time the deliberation period may extend to the Council meeting after that.
