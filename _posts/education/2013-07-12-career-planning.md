Qualified planners in Ireland work in a range of sectors. The majority work in the public sector for Local Authorities or in the private sector representing and working with construction, community, public and other bodies through the planning process.

For posts advertised in the local authority sector, senior grade posts are generally advertised through the public appointments service (www.publicjobs.ie), and all other grades by the local authority themselves through adverts in national papers and on the Council websites. Other public bodies will either advertise directly or use the public appointments service. Private consultants use both the national papers and recruitment firms to identify new staff. The IPI offers an advertising service to all bodies and current vacancies can be viewed on the Job Listings page.
