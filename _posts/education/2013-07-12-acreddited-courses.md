IPI ACCREDITED COURSES

The IPI inspects and accredits on invitation a number of planning courses across the island of Ireland. A list of currently accredited courses is shown below.

Accreditation by the IPI of a course indicates to future employers of graduates that the standard of education received has provided the person with the necessary skills to undertake a career as a planning professional, and is of considerable advantage to persons seeking to be recruited as planners to both the public and private sector.
