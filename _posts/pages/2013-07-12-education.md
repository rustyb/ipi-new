As the main professional body for planners in Ireland, the IPI is one of the nominated bodies under the European Commission Directive on Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications and acts as a regulatory agency for planning practice in Ireland. The IPI inspects and accredits on invitation a number of planning courses across the island of Ireland. A list of currently accredited courses is shown below.

Accreditation by the IPI of a course indicates to future employers of graduates that the standard of education received has provided the person with the necessary skills to undertake a career as a planning professional, and is of considerable advantage to persons seeking to be recruited as planners to both the public and private sector.

**Dublin Institute of Technology**

- DT106 BSc in Planning & Environmental Management (4 year undergrad)
- DT123 MSc Spatial Planning (2.5 year part-time postgrad)
