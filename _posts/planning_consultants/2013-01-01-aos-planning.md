AOS Planning Limited is a recently established planning consultancy. Whilst our main focus is on serving the industrial and infrastructure sectors, we have extensive experience in all areas of planning consultancy and offer services in all areas to both public and private sector clients. 

Past experience, and the range of skills within the team, provide a keen understanding of larger-scale projects and insight into the particular needs and requirements of developers interacting with the planning system. 

In particular, our experience has allowed us to develop the skills in avoiding conflicts and unnecessary planning delays for projects. As a project team with a wide range of experience, we have developed a particularly non-adversarial approach to developments thereby retaining our good standing among private clients, and public authorities as well as the N.G.O. sector.
