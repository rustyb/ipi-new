The Irish Planning Institute (IPI) has welcomed the announcement of a new Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR).

Commenting IPI Public Relations Officer Henk van der Kamp said “An independent planning regulator is one of the recommendations from the Mahon report that the Institute welcomed. The Institute welcomes in particular the fact that planning research, education and investigation will form part of the functions of the Regulator.”

Mr. van der Kamp continued “It is clear that there is a need for a body to carry out, commission and disseminate planning research, expertise and best practice. The research and education work of the regulator however requires expertise. In order to be effective the Office of the Planning Regulator must be properly staffed and resourced for the long term. Ensuring the research and education work of the regulator is relevant, timely and accessible will be a key challenge.”
