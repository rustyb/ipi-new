On the second day (Friday) of the Irish Planning Institute’s Annual Conference in Belfast delegates will hear of a number of successful examples of urban regeneration in the city. Projects such as the Titanic Quarter, Victoria Square, Belfast’s Laganside, Waterfront and Gasworks will be highlighted in an address by Peter McNaney, Chief Executive of Belfast City Council who concludes “that to understand the future, one must first come to terms with the past”. 

According to Institute President Joanna Kelly  “By choosing Belfast as the location for our Annual Conference the Irish Planning Institute has been able to highlight the many achievements of the city in urban regeneration projects.”

> “The ongoing economic development of Belfast, which forms the second largest population centre on the island, underlines the potential role of the city in an all-island spatial planning framework and demonstrates the success of the city in recent years as a key engine of growth. The potential of developing synergies between Dublin and Belfast as the two main urban centres on the island deserves to be considered. With the improved transport connections between Dublin and Belfast in particular, the mutual benefits of such a strategy were clearly illustrated during the conference” Kelly concluded.
