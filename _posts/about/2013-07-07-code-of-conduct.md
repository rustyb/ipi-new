### PREAMBLE
The object of the Irish Planning Institute is to advance the art and science of urban, rural and regional planning in Ireland for the benefit of the community. A Member of the Institute is governed by the Memorandum and Articles of Association and by this Code of Conduct. A Member shall conduct himself or herself in such a manner as to uphold the reputation of the Institute and of the planning profession, and in no way to prejudice his or her own professional status as one who provides services related primarily to his or her professional training and experience with remuneration related strictly to those service in accordance with personal integrity.

Without prejudice to the generality of this statement, applicable as a standard of conduct to Members, whether in the public service, private consultancy, academic employment or in whatever capacity engaged as planners, the undermentioned numbered clauses spell out in more detail the requirements of this Code.

Any cases of alleged unprofessional conduct which are not specifically covered by those clauses will be dealt with having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. The provisions of this Code shall apply notwithstanding any permission or agreement to the contrary by or with the client or body employing or consulting the Member. In this Code, the term ‘Member’ means every Corporate Member of the Institute, and also, where appropriate, every Non-Corporate or other Member and every Student of the Institute.
